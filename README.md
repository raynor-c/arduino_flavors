# arduino_flavors
my little online repositories for some of my ongoing projects using the pro mini, uno, mega2560, and stm32 flavors.

My projects generally are borrowing snippets of code from the works of others, modified to better fit my own needs. If you are one of the people I've borrowed code from, thank you! I stand on the shoulders of giants!

Projects I'm working on:

Swimming pool semi-automation:
        This entails filter pump controls, chlorine injection, temperature monitoring, and lighting. Logging and controls accessible from my computer, using nRF24L01+ modules, and possibly ESP8266.
        
Weatherstation:
        The project name speaks for itself. As I get into it, I'll be trying to take it wireless, using the ESP8266, to set it up on the Weather Underground network
        
Home lighting and refridgeration controls:
        HVAC and food storage are both included in the refridgeration aspects.
        
Fuel injection and Ignition for single cylinder engines:
        Not yet started, ideas are still just floating around in my head.
